    "# Tailscale Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the concept of a Tailscale mesh network and how to set it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Tailscale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailscale is a zero-config VPN based on WireGuard that installs on any device in minutes, enabling secure, encrypted connectivity between your servers, computers, and cloud instances. It creates a secure network mesh between your devices, regardless of their physical location or the networks they are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of Tailscale\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Zero Configuration**: Easy setup without complex firewall rules or network configurations.\n",
    "-   **WireGuard-based**: Leverages the security and performance of the WireGuard protocol.\n",
    "-   **Identity-based Security**: Uses existing identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, GitHub) for authentication.\n",
    "-   **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Fine-grained control over which devices can connect to each other.\n",
    "-   **Subnet Routers**: Allows devices in your Tailscale network to access devices on your physical subnets that don't have Tailscale installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a Tailscale Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up Tailscale typically involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Installing Tailscale**: Install the client on your devices (laptops, servers, VMs).\n",
    "2.  **Authenticating Devices**: Log in with your identity provider to add devices to your Tailscale network.\n",
    "3.  **Configuring ACLs**: Optionally define access rules for your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Placeholder for a Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This section could contain a code example demonstrating how to interact with the Tailscale API, or how to use Tailscale commands to manage your network."
