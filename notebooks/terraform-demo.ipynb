    "# Terraform Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a demonstration of Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Terraform?\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform is an open-source IaC tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. With Terraform, you can manage a wide range of resources, including virtual machines, networks, and databases, across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and on-premise solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts of Terraform\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.\n",
    "-   **Providers**: Terraform relies on providers to interact with cloud platforms and other services. Each provider offers resources that Terraform can manage.\n",
    "-   **Resources**: These are the infrastructure components (e.g., a virtual machine, a network interface, a database).\n",
    "-   **Modules**: Reusable, shareable, and composable infrastructure configurations.\n",
    "-   **State**: Terraform maintains a state file that maps real-world resources to your configuration, tracks metadata, and improves performance for large infrastructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Terraform Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Write Configuration**: Define your infrastructure in `.tf` files using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).\n",
    "2.  **Initialize**: Run `terraform init` to download necessary provider plugins.\n",
    "3.  **Plan**: Run `terraform plan` to see what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state without making any changes.\n",
    "4.  **Apply**: Run `terraform apply` to execute the planned actions and provision your infrastructure.\n",
    "5.  **Destroy**: Run `terraform destroy` to tear down all the infrastructure managed by your Terraform configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Placeholder for a Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This section could contain a code example demonstrating a simple Terraform configuration, such as provisioning a basic cloud resource."
