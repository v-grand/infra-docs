    "# CI/CD Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview and example of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is CI/CD?\n",
    "\n",
    "CI/CD is a method to deliver apps frequently to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.\n",
    "- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: An extension of CI to ensure that software can be released reliably at any time.\n",
    "- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: An advanced form of CD where every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example CI/CD Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example of a CI/CD workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Code Commit**: Developer pushes code to a version control system (e.g., Git).\n",
    "2.  **Build**: An automated system compiles the code and creates an artifact.\n",
    "3.  **Test**: Automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are run against the artifact.\n",
    "4.  **Deploy**: If all tests pass, the artifact is deployed to a staging or production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Placeholder for a Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This section could contain a code example demonstrating a part of a CI/CD pipeline, such as a script for building a Docker image or deploying to a cloud service."
